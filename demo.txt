Case: Waman Rao And Ors vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors.


Appeal

Facts:
The Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings) Act, 1961, which limits agricultural landholdings, faced amendments in 1975 and 1976. These amendments were legally challenged in the Bombay High Court, which rejected the claims, stating they aligned with the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution and were protected under the Ninth Schedule through the Constitution's 17th and 40th Amendments. The High Court's decision, upheld by the Supreme Court in the Dattatraya Govind Mahajan case (1977), ruled that even if the provisions violated the second proviso to Article 31A(1), they were shielded by Article 31B. After the Emergency was revoked, further petitions led to the Supreme Court's decision to reconsider the judgment in Dattatraya Govind Mahajan.

Issues:
1. The constitutionality of Articles 31A, 31B, and the unamended Article 31C.
2. The application of the doctrine of stare decisis in upholding these Articles.
3. The justiciability of the proclamations of emergency and subsequent legislation extending the Lok Sabhaâ€™s term.

Judgments Reviewed:
1. Bombay High Court ruling in Vithalrao Udhaorao Uttarwar v. State of Maharashtra (1976).
2. Supreme Court ruling in Dattatraya Govind Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra (1977).

Judge's Observations and Applicable Laws:
Chief Justice Chandrachud and other judges observed that Article 31A was inserted to protect agrarian reform legislation, aiming to subserve a fundamental constitutional purpose. It was held that this amendment did not damage the basic structure of the Constitution, as emphasized by the historical, social, and economic contexts, such as the Objectives Resolution and subsequent amendments.

Laws Reviewed:
- Article 14 and Article 19 (Fundamental Rights).
- Article 31A protects agrarian reforms from judicial review under Articles 14 and 19.
- Article 31B offers protective cover to laws listed in the Ninth Schedule against fundamental rights violations.
- The unamended Article 31C was limited to laws implementing Directive Principles in Clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39.

Conclusion:
The Supreme Court upheld the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, and the Constitution (Fourth Amendment) Act, 1955, deeming them valid and within the constituent power of Parliament. Laws included in the Ninth Schedule before April 24, 1973, were protected against challenges by Articles 14, 19, and 31. Amendments post-April 24, 1973, are subject to scrutiny under the Kesavananda Bharati doctrine to ensure they do not destroy the Constitution's basic structure. Consequently, the writ petitions and review petitions contesting Maharashtra Agricultural Lands Ceiling Acts were dismissed with costs.
