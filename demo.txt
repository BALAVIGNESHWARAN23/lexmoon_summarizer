Case: Waman Rao And Ors vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors.

Appeal

Facts:
The case concerns a legal challenge to the Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings) Act, 27 of 1961, and its subsequent amendments by Acts 21 of 1975, 41 of 1975, and 2 of 1976. Initially, the Bombay High Court upheld the Act, rejecting claims that it violated the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution, as the provisions were placed in the Ninth Schedule by the Constitution's 17th and 40th Amendments. The High Court ruled that Article 31B, introduced by the First Amendment Act, 1951, strengthened the Constitution's basic structure. The petitioners argued that specific amendments created an artificial 'family unit' and were beyond the purview of Article 31A, challenging them on various grounds.

Issues:
- The primary issue is whether Articles 31A, 31B, and the unamended Article 31C of the Constitution are valid, and if they damage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution as defined in Kesavananda Bharati.
- Another issue is whether the laws included in the Ninth Schedule after the decision in Kesavananda Bharati can be challenged.

Previous Hearings:
The validity of the challenged acts and constitutional amendments was previously upheld by this Court in Dattatraya Govind Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra, holding that the amended Principal Act did not violate the second proviso to Article 31A(1), and that Article 31B protected the Acts included in the Ninth Schedule from such challenges. The Court also reviewed whether later proclamations of emergency and extensions of the Lok Sabha's term were valid.

Judgment:
The Court reaffirmed the previous judgements, rejecting the petitioners' appeals.

Judgeâ€™s Observations:
Chief Justice Chandrachud's observations focused on the history, purpose, and legal precedent of agrarian reforms and basic structure doctrine. The judgment reiterated the findings and philosophy established in cases such as Kesavananda Bharati, which established that fundamental constitutional features cannot be altered by amendments. The majority in Kesavananda Bharati upheld the first part of Article 31C while striking down its conclusive declaration provision. The Court emphasized the importance of agrarian reforms as essential to the Constitution's objectives.

Conclusion:
- The Court upheld the constitutional validity of the First and Fourth Amendments introducing and amending Articles 31A, 31B while affirming that no provisions of Part III of the Constitution invalidate the Acts included in the Ninth Schedule prior to April 24, 1973.
- The validity of laws included in the Ninth Schedule after April 24, 1973, was made conditional on their consistency with the basic structure of the Constitution.
- The unamended Article 31C's protection was affirmed within the scope validated by Kesavananda Bharati.
- The writ petitions and review petitions challenging the Maharashtra Agricultural Lands Ceiling Acts were dismissed.
